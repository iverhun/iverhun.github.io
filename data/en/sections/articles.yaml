    summary: |
      Authentication factors fall into three categories: something you know (knowledge factor), something you have (possession factor), and something you are (inherence factor). E.g., passwords and security questions belong to the knowledge factor category.

      Since each type is prone to different risks, MFA methods combine multiple factor types to overlap gaps and strengthen the overall security.

      But considering all the weaknesses the knowledge factor possesses, would it be enough to use only possession and inherence factors? A new specification approved by the W3C and FIDO in 2019 — Web Authentication API (also known as WebAuthn) tries to solve precisely this problem.

      One fundamental engineering values is knowledge sharing. Therefore, I and my friends regularly participate in technical meetups and conferences organization, and one of our most important goals is to ensure the highest quality of technical talks.       
      
      Just like famous GoF collected and described the most typical design patterns in software, our team collected a set of common mistakes speakers make during their talks over several years.

    summary: |
      Why are even the biggest and most reach companies vulnerable to data thefts despite they invest an enormous amount of money and effort on their IT systems security?
      I doubt anyone has the right answer to this question, but I believe one of the reasons (probably not the most important though) is that many software engineers blindly follow some security recommendations, without a clear understanding of the topic.
      Let’s look at one of the common authentication techniques — Multi-Factor authentication, or MFA in short and think what approach to MFA is secure enough in your particular case.
