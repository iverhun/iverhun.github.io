- name: Java
  logo: /images/sections/skills/java.svg
  summary: "Java is my first and lifelong love 💙 Since version 1.4 (2004), it has inspired me with its elegance and power. Java is one of my primary choices for enterprise-scale applications and small POCs. Spring Framework, Hibernate, and Maven are my pets 🐶"

- name: Python
  logo: /images/sections/skills/python.svg
  summary: "🐍 Python is my best friend when it comes to scripting and pet projects for home usage, such as TV Photo Frame or IoT backend apps. Pandas 🐼 Numpy, and Matplotlib 📈 are great for data processing and analysis. And Turtle 🐢 is fun when we learn programming with my kids."
#  url: "https://www.python.org/"

- name: AWS Cloud Computing
  logo: /images/sections/skills/aws.svg
  summary: "Amplify, ALB, Cognito, CloudFront, CloudWatch, GuardDuty, ECS, KMS, Lambda, RDS... Phew... 🥵 Let me stop here, even though this is not the end of the list of the services I have used to build scalable, secure applications on top of AWS."

- name: Docker
  logo: /images/sections/skills/docker.svg
  summary: "📦 Whether deploying in ECS or Kubernetes, testing with TestContainers, starting multiple services with Docker Compose, or keeping my hard drive clean by using yet another DB in a container, Docker is about simplicity, safety, and order."
#  url: "https://www.docker.com/"

- name: Databases
  logo: /images/sections/skills/database-sql.svg
  summary: "Designing DB schemas, troubleshooting and optimizing queries, data migrations, and schema evolution - this is what I do with confidence 🧑🏽‍💻 My favorite RDBMSs are MySql and PostgreSQL, but I feel excited about exploring others SQL and NoSQL DBs such as MongoDBB or AWS DynamoDB."

- name: Linux
  logo: /images/sections/skills/linux.svg
  summary: "When “talking” to a computer, I’m a CLI guy 🖥️, preferring text commands over UI controls. Linux offers the best CLI experience, powerful scripting capabilities, and a robust security model. Indeed, I’m not a Linux hacker, but my knowledge of Linux allows me to conduct training and mentor others 🎓"

- name: Event Driven Apps
  logo: /images/sections/skills/mq.svg
  summary: "I have been using JMS (ActveMQ), AMQP (RabbitMQ 🐰) and Kafka for enterprise apps, and MQTT for home-made IoT projects."

- name: Git and CI/CD
  logo: /images/sections/skills/git.svg
  summary: "I'm one of those who know exactly [how Rebase in Git works](https://youtu.be/Xk5hH79dCBU?si=XdTjq3e-XLIy21Ah), and I'm happily sharing this knowledge with others. I can also configure a build pipeline, whether it is GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. The same applies to AWS CodeCommit, Azure Repos, or the old good Jenkins."

- name: Agile
  logo: /images/sections/skills/scrum.svg
  summary: "The Agile development process is like a game. Not only do I know the rules, but I also love to make them serve the team so that the team is productive and motivated. Scrum or KanBan depends on a few factors, but the focus is always on achieving the result."
